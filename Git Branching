Creating a new branch:

  Option 1:
    
    git branch <branch-name>
    git branch                  // lists the names of branches in repo
    git checkout <branch-name>
    
 
  Option 2:
  
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    

Merging branches:

  Checkout to the master(target) branch.
  
    git merge <branch-name>
  
  
Deleting a branch:

  1. Safely delete a branch.This prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
  
    git branch -d <branch>
    
  2. Force delete branch even if there are unmerged changes.
  
    git branch -D <branch>
    
  3. This will push a delete signal to the remote origin repository that triggers a delete of the remote crazy-experiment branch.
  
    git push origin --delete crazy-experiment

      Or

    git push origin :crazy-experiment
    
 
 Rename a branch:
 
  Rename the current branch to <branch>.

    git branch -m <branch>
